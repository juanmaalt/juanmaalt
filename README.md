# Hi there

### About me
I´m Juan, a Software Systems Engineering student who is passionate about building things. <br> I would describe myself as a teamplayer, that is always seeking to learn and looking to the future, to new challenges. <br> On this GitHub, you will find projects made on Android, Kotlin, Java, Javascript, React and React Native (coming soon).

### Projects
These are some of the projects that you´ll find on this profile:

* [Image Server](https://github.com/juanmaalt/image_server) - An API that allows you to store and retrieve images (also files) from an S3 bucket or file system.
* [MyPass](https://github.com/juanmaalt/mypass) - Lightweight portable password manager.

#### See ya!
