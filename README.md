# Hi 👋

## About
I'm Juan, a Software Engineer focused on building maintainable systems, making pragmatic technical decisions, and aligning engineering work with product goals and business outcomes.

Most of my work is not publicly visible. I work on production-grade systems, help define technical direction, and build real-world products outside of my day-to-day work, such as platforms like [Plurals](https://plurals.io).

## Interests
- Backend systems and APIs
- Software architecture and clean code
- Engineering leadership and product thinking
- Creating products with real users and real constraints

Thanks for stopping by.
